    <h2><a href="/en/posts/wzorzec-visitor-czyli-separacja-danych-i-zachowania/">Visitor pattern - separation of data and behavior</a></h2>
    <p>The visitor pattern separates the data from the algorithm. I will show with examples when it is worth using this pattern and when it is not. It is noteworthy that we do not always want such a separation.</p>
  
    <h2><a href="/en/posts/jak-zaimplementowac-sile-tarcia-w-grze/">How to implement frictional in a game</a></h2>
    <p>Some time ago I watched a YouTube video in which indie game developer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@randyprime">@randy</a> showed how he implemented physics in his game. My attention was drawn to the incorrectly (not in accordance with the rules of physics) implemented frictional force. In this post I will answer why.</p>
  
    <h2><a href="/en/posts/visual-studio-avalonia-goto-definition-decompiled/">Visual Studio jumps to [decompiled] file instead of original source</a></h2>
    <p>When you create a default Avalonia (C#) project using the Visual Studio wizard, you may find that go to type definition option will open [decompiled] sources instead of the original files. This can be frustrating when you want to preview how Avalonia does things underneath. Let&rsquo;s fix it.</p>
  
    <h2><a href="/en/posts/perfectionism-the-killer-of-productivity/">Perfectionism — the killer of productivity</a></h2>
    <p>Perfectionism is the worst enemy of productivity. Surely everyone has at some point fallen into the trap of endless tweaking, constant dissatisfaction and starting over.</p>
  
    <h2><a href="/en/posts/google-mock-override-expect-call/">Google Mock: Override EXPECT_CALL</a></h2>
    <p><strong>EXPECT_CALL is not overridable</strong>. This does not mean that you cannot have multiple <code>EXPECT_CALL</code>s for the same function.</p>
  
    <h2><a href="/en/posts/google-mock-on-call-&#43;-expect-call/">Google Mock: ON_CALL &#43; EXPECT_CALL</a></h2>
    <p>A short post about how <code>ON_CALL</code> and <code>EXPECT_CALL</code> can complement each other. It is worth remembering that <code>EXPECT_CALL</code> does not &ldquo;override&rdquo; behaviors defined by <code>ON_CALL</code>. Both of these macros can be used simultaneously on the same mock.</p>
  
    <h2><a href="/en/posts/reflection-on-the-success-of-steve-jobs/">A reflection on the success of Steve Jobs based on the book &#34;Steve Jobs&#34; by Walter Isaacson</a></h2>
    <p>My goal for reading the book ‘Steve Jobs’ by Walter Isaacson was to extract clues and maybe even advice that could help to repeat the kind of spectacular success that the founder of Apple achieved. Years later I found this essay and thought it was interesting enough to publish. You can find its content below.</p>
  
    <h2><a href="/en/posts/how-this-blog-was-created/">How this blog was created</a></h2>
    <p>It is now standard for me to open each of my new blogs with a post about how they came to exist. I already have at least 5 blogs behind me, each built on a different technology. This time I decided to use <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>.</p>
