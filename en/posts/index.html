    <h2><a href="/en/posts/visual-studio-avalonia-goto-definition-decompiled/">Visual Studio jumps to [decompiled] file instead of original source</a></h2>
    <p>When you create a default Avalonia (C#) project using the Visual Studio wizard, you may find that go to type definition option will open [decompiled] sources instead of the original files. This can be frustrating when you want to preview how Avalonia does things underneath. Let&rsquo;s fix it.</p>
  
    <h2><a href="/en/posts/google-mock-override-expect-call/">Google Mock: Override EXPECT_CALL</a></h2>
    <p><strong>EXPECT_CALL is not overridable</strong>. This does not mean that you cannot have multiple <code>EXPECT_CALL</code>s for the same function.</p>
  
    <h2><a href="/en/posts/google-mock-on-call-&#43;-expect-call/">Google Mock: ON_CALL &#43; EXPECT_CALL</a></h2>
    <p>A short post about how <code>ON_CALL</code> and <code>EXPECT_CALL</code> can complement each other. It is worth remembering that <code>EXPECT_CALL</code> does not &ldquo;override&rdquo; behaviors defined by <code>ON_CALL</code>. Both of these macros can be used simultaneously on the same mock.</p>
  
    <h2><a href="/en/posts/reflection-on-the-success-of-steve-jobs/">A reflection on the success of Steve Jobs based on the book &#34;Steve Jobs&#34; by Walter Isaacson</a></h2>
    <p>At university I was given an assignment to read the book &lsquo;Steve Jobs&rsquo; by Walter Isaacson and write down my thoughts. The goal was to extract clues and maybe even advice that could help repeat the kind of spectacular success that the Apple founder achieved. Years later, I found this essay and thought it was interesting enough to be published. You can read it below.</p>
  
    <h2><a href="/en/posts/how-this-blog-was-created/">How this blog was created</a></h2>
    <p>It is now standard for me to open each of my new blogs with a post about how they came to exist. I already have at least 5 blogs behind me, each built on a different technology. This time I decided to use <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>.</p>
