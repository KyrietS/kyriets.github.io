      <description>&lt;p&gt;At university I was given an assignment to read the book &amp;lsquo;Steve Jobs&amp;rsquo; by Walter Isaacson and write down my thoughts. The goal was to extract clues and maybe even advice that could help repeat the kind of spectacular success that the Apple founder achieved. Years later, I found this essay and thought it was interesting enough to be published. You can read it below.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is now standard for me to open each of my new blogs with a post about how they came to exist. I already have at least 5 blogs behind me, each built on a different technology. This time I decided to use &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
